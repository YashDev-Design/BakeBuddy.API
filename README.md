## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YashDev-Design/MyDeserts-API.git
cd "Node - JS Project"
```

---

### 2️⃣ Setup the Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `/server`:
```bash
PORT=10000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
